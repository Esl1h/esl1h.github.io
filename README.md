# Jake

Jake is a tool that allows you to effortlessly create your own one-link website and deploy it on your GitHub account.

## Usage

### Create a Repository
To get started, follow these steps to create a new repository using this template:

1. Click [here](https://github.com/new?template_name=jake&template_owner=thevahidal) to create a new repository.
2. Choose a name for your repository. If you want your website to be deployed at `<yourusername>.github.io`, name your repository `<yourusername>.github.io`. Alternatively, you can choose any other name, such as `that-other-name`, which will result in your website being deployed at `<yourusername>.github.io/that-other-name/`.

### Enable GitHub Pages
After creating the repository, you need to enable GitHub Pages. Follow these steps:

1. Go to your repository's `Settings` tab.
2. Navigate to the `Pages` section.
3. Choose `GitHub Actions` as the source for your GitHub Pages.
4. Click `Save` to apply the changes.

### Voila!
That's all you need to do. Now, you can sit back and relax while your website gets deployed. You can monitor the progress in the `Actions` tab of your repository. Once the deployment is complete, you can access your brand new one-link website at `<yourusername>.github.io` or `<yourusername>.github.io/repo-name/`.

Feel free to customize your website by modifying the code and adding your own content.
